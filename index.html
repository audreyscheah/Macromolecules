  <h1>Macromolecules</h1>
  <h2>Inroduction</h2>
  <p>Macromolecules, otherwise known as biomolecules, are large, organic polymers that consist of smaller units, called monomers.</p>
  <br></br>
  <h2>Dehydration Synthesis and Hydrolysis</h3>
  <p>Monomers are chemically combined with each other through <span id = "dehydrationsynthesis">dehydration synthesis</span>, which releases water, while polymers are broken down though <span id = "hydrolysis">hydrolysis</span>, which occurs upon the addition of water to the substance.</p>

  <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
  <p>Carbohydrates consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.</p>
  <p>monomer: monosaccharides (simple sugars)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>glucose (produced by plants through photosynthesis)</li>
    <li>galactose (found in milk)</li>
    <li>fructose (found in fruits)</li>
    <li>ribose / deoxyribose (five carbon; found in nucleic acids)</li>
   </ul> 
  <p>disaccharides (monosaccharide + monosaccharide)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>maltose (glucose + glucose; malt sugar)</li>
    <li>lactose (glucose + galactose; milk sugar)</li>
    <li>sucrose (glucose + fructose; table sugar)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>polymer: polysaccharides (complex carbohydrates)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>chitin (fungi cell walls; insect exoskeletons)</li>
    <li>cellulose (plant cell walls; fiber)</li>
    <li>glycogen (animal stored sugar)</li>
    <li>starch (plant stored sugar; consists of amylose and amylopectin)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Carbohydrates provide short-term energy and contribute to cell structure.</p>

  <h2>Lipids</h2>
  <p>Lipids consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.</p>
  <p>monomers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>glycerol</li>
    <li>fatty acids</li>
    <ul>
      <li>saturated (maximum bonding between carbon and hydrogebn; usually solid; originate from animals)</li>
      <li>unsaturated (contain carbon double bond(s); usually liquid; originate from plants)</li>
      <li>trans (unsaturated fat in a rigid, solid structure; usually artificial; allow for longer preservation)</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>polymers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>fats (solid, originate from animals)</li>
    <li>oils (liquid, originate from plants)</li>
    <li>waxes (solid originate from plants)</li>
    <li>phospholipids (contain phosphorous; make up cell membranes)</li>
    <li>steroids (ex. cholesterol)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Lipids provide energy storage, insulation, and protection.</p>

  <h2>Proteins</h2>
  <p>Proteins consist of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.</p>
  <p>monomer: amino acids (peptides)</p>
  <p>There are twenty amino acid types, nine of which are essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized by the human body.</p>
  <p>can be either hydrophobic (ex. alenine, leucine, valine) or hydrophilic (ex. histodine, glutamine, serine)</p>
  <p>polymer: polypeptide chains</p>
  <p>primary structure: sequence of amino acids (peptide bonding)</p>
  <p>secondary structure: alpha helix or beta pleated sheet (hydrogen bonding)</p>
  <p>tertiary structure: 3-D polypeptide chain (disulfide, hydrogen, and ionic bonding; hydrophobic amino acids are located towars the inside while hydrophilic amino acids are located towards the outside)</p>
  <p>quaternary structure: multiple polypeptide chains</p>
  <p>types of proteins:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>enzymes: catalyze chemical reactions (ex. amylase - breaks down amylose)
    <li>structural: support body shape and structure (ex. keratin - hair, horns, feathers; collagen - connective tissue)</li>
    <li>transport: support circulation of substances throughout body (ex. hemoglobin - transports oxygen in blood; aquaporins - manages entrance and exit of water into and out of cells)</li>
    <li>motor/contractile: enable motion (ex. myosin + actin - muscle contraction)</li>
    <li>receptor: detect stimuli (ex. rhodopsin - in eye)</li>
    <li>regulatory: maintain homeostasis (ex. insulin - regulates glucose levels / blood sugar)
    <li>defensive: protect body from pathogens (ex. interleukin 2, antibodies)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>amino acid order determines protein shape</p>
  <p>protein shape determines protein function</p>
  <p>protein shape can be altered by genetic mutations, heat, or a change in pH</p>

  <h2>Nucleic Acids</h2>
  <p>Nucleic acids consist of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorous.</p>
  <p>monomer: nucleotides (contain a phosphate group, a five carbon sugar, and a nitrogenous base - adenine, thymine, uracil, guanine, cytosine)</p>
  <p>polymers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ATP (adenosine triphosphate; nucleotide with three phosphate groups; form of energy)</li>
    <li>RNA (ribonucleic acid; usually single stranded)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>microRNA (binds to mRNA)</li>
      <li>mRNA (messenger RNA; copies and transports genetic information)</li>
      <li>rRNA (ribosomal RNA; found in ribosomes)</li>
      <li>tRNA (transfer RNA; supports protein synthesis)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid; usually double stranded; provides genetic information)</li>
  </ul>
